  <!-- Additional Content: Engineered for Heavy Loads -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Engineered for Heavy Loads</h2>
      <p>Parking lots endure daily punishment from passenger cars, delivery trucks and heavy construction vehicles.  To withstand that constant stress, the foundation needs to be engineered from the ground up.  Our process starts with excavating to the proper depth and installing a compacted sub‑base using crushed rock or recycled concrete.  Over that, we add a graded layer of aggregate base that distributes weight evenly and provides the perfect platform for asphalt, concrete or gravel surfacing.  The result is a stable parking lot that stays level and drains water efficiently, reducing potholes and maintenance costs over the long term.</p>
      <p>We work closely with property owners, architects and civil engineers to choose the right materials and thicknesses for each application.  In high‑traffic zones or areas subject to heavy truck loads, we may recommend thicker base layers or the use of fines that interlock for additional strength.  Our expertise in materials means we can tailor the mix – using limestone for superior compaction or granite for added durability – while still offering competitive pricing.  Every lot we build is designed to handle its intended use and keep your customers and employees safe.</p>

  <!-- Additional Content: Full‑Service Lot Preparation -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Full‑Service Lot Preparation</h2>
      <p>Constructing or renovating a parking lot involves more than just dumping rock and grading it flat.  We provide comprehensive lot preparation services that include clearing and hauling away old surfaces, shaping the subgrade to ensure proper drainage, compacting soil to prevent settling, and installing geotextile fabric where necessary to stabilize soft soils.  Once the site is ready, we deliver and spread your chosen base material, then compact it in layers to achieve the specified density.  We can also coordinate with asphalt or concrete crews to ensure a seamless transition from base to finished surface.</p>
      <p>If your lot requires unique features – such as lined spaces, accessible parking, heavy equipment pads, or integrated landscaping islands – we’ll plan and build those elements into the design.  We also offer maintenance services such as grading, pothole repair and top dressing to extend the life of gravel lots.  Our goal is to be your partner throughout the lifecycle of your parking area, from initial construction through ongoing upkeep.  With Rocky Top Rock, you get a turnkey solution that ensures your parking lot is safe, compliant and ready to welcome visitors.</p>
