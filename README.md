# Rocky Top Rock Website

This repository contains the static HTML and CSS files for the **Rocky Top Rock** website.  
The site is designed to generate leads for rock, gravel and dump‑truck delivery services, using a rugged yet approachable brand style.  
It includes a homepage and dedicated landing pages for rock &amp; aggregate supply, dump‑truck delivery, and landscaping services.

## Features

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:
