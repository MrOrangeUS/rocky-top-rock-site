  <!-- Additional Content: Designing Durable Driveways -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Designing Durable Driveways</h2>
      <p>A well‑constructed driveway begins long before the first load of gravel arrives.  We’ll help you plan the layout, taking into account your property’s slope, drainage requirements and the vehicles that will use the surface.  A properly engineered sub‑base of compacted rock or crushed concrete sets the stage for a driveway that resists rutting and potholes for years.  For steep driveways, we may recommend interlocking or crushed stone that locks together for better traction.  Our team can also advise on driveway width, turning radius and tie‑ins to roads or garages to ensure safe access for vehicles of all sizes.</p>
      <p>One size doesn’t fit all; that’s why we offer multiple aggregate options to match your budget and aesthetic.  Clean chip rock and decomposed granite provide a refined, modern look; river rock and pea gravel add natural charm; and crushed limestone offers excellent compaction for heavy‑duty applications.  We also consider local climate and soil composition, recommending materials that shed water quickly and prevent erosion in rainy seasons.  With Rocky Top Rock, you get a driveway designed for performance and curb appeal.</p>

  <!-- Additional Content: Enhancements & Maintenance -->
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Enhancements &amp; Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Your driveway is more than a utilitarian surface – it frames your home or business and can add to its value.  Consider finishing touches such as decorative edging, boulder borders or brick pavers along the sides to define the space and keep gravel contained.  Installing weed barrier fabric beneath the base layer helps suppress unwanted growth, while a top dressing of fresh gravel every few years refreshes the look and maintains proper drainage.  We can also incorporate permeable pavers or poured concrete accents for a custom design that stands out from standard gravel driveways.</p>
      <p>To keep your driveway in peak condition, regular maintenance is key.  We recommend periodic raking or grading to level out minor ruts, adding material as needed to maintain thickness, and cleaning culverts or ditches to ensure water can flow away freely.  Because we know every property is different, we’re happy to set up a service schedule for regrading and gravel replenishment.  With our comprehensive supply, installation and maintenance services, your driveway will remain safe, functional and attractive for years to come.</p>
